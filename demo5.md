 # Library API Demo with GitHub Copilot
 
 ## Introduction
 This demo showcases how to use GitHub Copilot for code completion and test case generation in a sample Java project. We will use the [Library API](https://github.com/mahendra-shinde/library-api) project as an example.
 

 ## Prerequisites

 *   Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
 *   Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code
 *   GitHub Copilot extension installed and configured in your IDE
 

 ## Code Completion Demo
 

 1.  **Clone the Library API repository:**
 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mahendra-shinde/library-api.git
    cd library-api
    ```


 2.  **Open the project in your VSCode.**
 3.  **Explore the existing code:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure and classes, such as `Book`, `BookDAO`, and `BooksController`.
 4.  **Start coding and use Copilot for suggestions:**
 

    *   Open `BooksController.java` and start typing a new method, like `findBookByTitle`. Copilot will suggest code completions as you type.
 

    ```java
    public Book findBookByTitle(String title) {
    // Copilot will suggest code to search for a book by title
    }
    ```
 

    *   Accept Copilot's suggestions by pressing `Tab`.
 

 ## Test Case Generation Demo
 
 1.  **Open the `BooksController` class in your IDE.**
 
 2.  **Create a test class:** 
    Open BooksController.java Using Copilot Edit or Agent, use prompt `/Test Generate Tests for BooksController`
    
 3.  **Use Copilot to generate test cases:**
 
    *   In the test class, start writing a test method for one of the controller methods (e.g., `getAllBooks`). Copilot will suggest a basic test structure.
 

    ```java
    import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
    import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;
 

    class BooksControllerTest {
 

    @Test
    void testGetAllBooks() {
    // Copilot will suggest test case code to verify the getAllBooks method
    }
    }
    ```


 4.  **Accept and expand Copilot's suggestions:** Copilot can help generate assertions and mock necessary dependencies.
 
 5.  **Repeat for other methods:** Generate test cases for other methods in `BooksController`, such as `getBook`, `addBook`, etc.
 

    ```java
    @Test
    void testGetBook() {
    // Copilot will suggest test case code to verify the getBook method
    }
 

    @Test
    void testAddBook() {
    // Copilot will suggest test case code to verify the addBook method
    }
    ```
 

 3.  **Review and modify the generated test cases:** Ensure the test cases cover different scenarios and edge cases.
 

 ## Example Scenario
 

 - Use copilot to create other Model class: Member with attributes: memberId, firstName, lastName, email

- Use copilot to generate DAO Object for Member which should provide features similar to BookDAO.
 
- Use copilot to generate REST Endpoints for Memeber (MemberController).

- Generate Unit Test cases for Member Controller

 ## Conclusion


 GitHub Copilot can significantly speed up development by providing intelligent code completion and generating test cases. Remember to review and adapt Copilot's suggestions to fit your specific needs and coding style.
