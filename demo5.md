# Library API Demo with GitHub Copilot

## Introduction

This demo showcases how to use GitHub Copilot for code completion and test case generation in a sample Java project. We will use the [Library API](https://github.com/mahendra-shinde/library-api) project as an example.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed
- **IDE** such as IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code
- **GitHub Copilot extension** installed and configured in your IDE

---

## Code Completion Demo

### 1. Clone the Library API Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahendra-shinde/library-api.git
cd library-api
```

### 2. Open the Project

Open the project in your VS Code or preferred IDE.

### 3. Explore the Existing Code

Familiarize yourself with the project structure and classes, such as `Book`, `BookDAO`, and `BooksController`.

### 4. Use Copilot for Code Suggestions

- Open `BooksController.java` and start typing a new method, like `findBookByTitle`. Copilot will suggest code completions as you type.

```java
public Book findBookByTitle(String title) {
    // Copilot will suggest code to search for a book by title
}
```

- Accept Copilot's suggestions by pressing `Tab`.

---

## Test Case Generation Demo

### 1. Open the `BooksController` Class

Open `BooksController.java` in your IDE.

### 2. Create a Test Class

Create a new test class, e.g., `BooksControllerTest.java`. You can use Copilot Edit or Agent with the prompt:

```
/Test Generate Tests for BooksController
```

### 3. Use Copilot to Generate Test Cases

Start writing a test method for one of the controller methods (e.g., `getAllBooks`). Copilot will suggest a basic test structure.

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class BooksControllerTest {
    @Test
    void testGetAllBooks() {
        // Copilot will suggest test case code to verify the getAllBooks method
    }
}
```

- Accept and expand Copilot's suggestions. Copilot can help generate assertions and mock necessary dependencies.
- Repeat for other methods, such as `getBook`, `addBook`, etc.:

```java
@Test
void testGetBook() {
    // Copilot will suggest test case code to verify the getBook method
}

@Test
void testAddBook() {
    // Copilot will suggest test case code to verify the addBook method
}
```

- Review and modify the generated test cases to ensure they cover different scenarios and edge cases.

## Example Scenario: Adding a Member Entity

### 1. Create the `Member` Model Class

Use Copilot to create a new model class `Member` with the following attributes:

- `memberId` (int or String)
- `firstName` (String)
- `lastName` (String)
- `email` (String)

**Example:**

```java
public class Member {
    private int memberId;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private String email;

    // Getters and setters
    // Constructor(s)
    // toString(), equals(), hashCode()
}
```

### 2. Generate DAO Object for Member

Use Copilot to generate a `MemberDAO` class that provides features similar to `BookDAO`, such as:

- CRUD operations (add, update, delete, find by ID, find all)
- In-memory storage or database integration

**Example:**

```java
public class MemberDAO {
    // Methods: addMember, updateMember, deleteMember, getMemberById, getAllMembers
}
```

### 3. Generate REST Endpoints for Member

Use Copilot to generate a `MemberController` class with REST endpoints for managing members:

- `GET /members` - List all members
- `GET /members/{id}` - Get member by ID
- `POST /members` - Add a new member
- `PUT /members/{id}` - Update member
- `DELETE /members/{id}` - Delete member

**Example:**

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/members")
public class MemberController {
    // Autowire MemberDAO
    // Implement REST endpoints
}
```

### 4. Generate Unit Test Cases for MemberController

Use Copilot to generate unit tests for `MemberController` covering all endpoints and edge cases.

**Example:**

```java
class MemberControllerTest {
    @Test
    void testGetAllMembers() {
        // Test code
    }
    // More tests for other endpoints
}
```

## Conclusion

GitHub Copilot can significantly speed up development by providing intelligent code completion and generating test cases. Remember to review and adapt Copilot's suggestions to fit your specific needs and coding style.
